# NROMToMapper474
This is a file converter that converts a plain NROM .NES ROM IMAGE and converts it to Mapper 474.

Submapper 0 is called NROM-383

Submapper 1 is called NROM-368

In either case the newly created ROM will have extra memory for patching.

Run the program.  It will output the usage from the command line.
